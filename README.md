 Network Traffic Analysis Report
This repository contains the analysis of a captured network traffic log, focusing on key protocols such as ARP, DNS, and ICMP. The report highlights host communication patterns, connectivity status, and protocol-specific behaviors based on the traffic observed.

 Report Summary
1. Overview of Network Activities
The analyzed network traffic includes:

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) ‚Äì Resolving IP to MAC addresses.

DNS (Domain Name System) ‚Äì Resolving domain names to IPs.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) ‚Äì Used for diagnostics (ping).

ICMPv6 ‚Äì IPv6 router discovery activity.

2. Host Identification
IP Address	MAC Address	Notes
192.168.197.132	PCSSystemtec_04:42:0f	Active, responded to ARP
192.168.197.204	f2:d8:cc:a3:8a:85	Active, performed ARP and DNS resolutions
192.168.197.223	Unknown	No ARP replies; possibly offline or unreachable
172.67.179.238	N/A	Public IP (resolved from DNS query)
fe80::1966:2077:...	N/A	IPv6 local-link address
ff02::2	N/A	IPv6 multicast (router solicitation)

üì° 3. Protocol-Specific Observations
üîÅ 3.1 ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
